= Usage =

After activating the plugin there is a new menu in your admin interface of WordPress called `Routeplaner`. Open the menu and choose `routes` from the submenu. 
Now click on `Create Route` and insert a destination. Change the rest of the settings like you want the map to look like. 

Save the route and you will recieve a code to insert into your page. The code looks like [googlerouteplaner=1] (the number is your routes id and changes for every route). Just insert this code to your page or post - done.
